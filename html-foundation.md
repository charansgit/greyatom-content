## Time for some HTML foundation notes

### Introduction
HTML is the point where you will probably start your career as a front end career. So it's very important to understand HTML and its foundation concepts. HTML is the document which is responsible for displaying content on the page and tells the browser how to display content on the page. Apart from creating webpages, you can also create games with the help of CSS and Javascript which are way more interesting and challenging to learn. Along with HTML, you should also learn CSS and Javascript to create the best possible webpages

Main objectives of learning this module would be:
- To be able to create a basic template for HTML
- To be able to apply attributes to elements

### What you will be able to build?
Once you have the confidence and clear understanding of how HTML works and how to structure the document with elements, you are ready to build something useful and applicable for the real world. How about a form which accepts user inputs for online hotel room booking. It looks exactly as below:

Ohh, wait... This looks ugly, or at least not appealing to the eyes, right? 
How can we make it look better? To do so, you will need a superpower tool named "CSS". Just take a look at how it looks post applying some CSS to the HTML elements which we have created.

Doesn't it look super attractive now? That's the power of CSS as it can transform weirdly looking HTML layout to something super awesome.
